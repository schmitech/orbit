# Vision Adapter System Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the plan for a dedicated vision-focused document adapter that complements the file adapter system. The vision adapter targets image-centric inputs (JPEG, PNG, TIFF, scanned PDFs) and orchestrates optical character recognition (OCR), layout analysis, and structured metadata extraction to deliver text and visual signals suitable for downstream retrieval, analytics, and compliance workloads.

## Strategic Goals

- **Vision-Native Processing**: Provide first-class support for image-based documents and scanned assets alongside binary file ingestion.
- **Configurable OCR Pipelines**: Support multiple OCR engines and models (Tesseract, PaddleOCR, TrOCR, LayoutLM-series) tuned per use case, GPU availability, and language pack requirements.
- **Layout-Aware Reconstruction**: Preserve document structure (columns, tables, stamps, handwriting) to improve semantic chunking and human audit workflows.
- **Unified Metadata Model**: Align extracted text, positional metadata, and embeddings with the core document schema so downstream systems consume a consistent interface.
- **Operational Reliability**: Deliver streaming ingestion, retry-safe processing, and detailed observability to meet enterprise throughput and accuracy targets.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

- `VisionAdapter` extends `DocumentAdapter`, orchestrating MinIO storage and OCR-specific processing steps.
- `OCRPipeline` selects and executes OCR engines, image preprocessing, and post-processing modules based on template configuration.
- `LayoutAnalyzer` normalizes bounding boxes, reading order, and region classification for text, tables, and images.
- `MetadataAssembler` fuses recognized text, layout metadata, embeddings, and lineage data into the standard document payload.
- `DuckDBViewBuilder` (optional) materializes structured outputs (tables, forms) into DuckDB for ad-hoc querying or post-processing analytics.

```python
class VisionAdapter(DocumentAdapter):
    def __init__(self, storage_client, ocr_pipeline, layout_analyzer, metadata_assembler, **kwargs):
        ...

    async def _process_image(self, object_ref: ObjectRef, template: VisionTemplate) -> ProcessedDocument:
        image_stream = await self.storage_client.stream(object_ref)
        preprocessed = await self.ocr_pipeline.preprocess(image_stream, template)
        ocr_result = await self.ocr_pipeline.extract_text(preprocessed, template)
        layout = await self.layout_analyzer.analyze(preprocessed, ocr_result, template)
        return await self.metadata_assembler.compose(ocr_result, layout, template)
```

### Storage & Metadata

- Store originals and intermediate artifacts in MinIO buckets consistent with the file adapter lifecycle (`documents`, `processed`, `temp`).
- Persist structured OCR outputs (text, bounding boxes, confidence scores) in a metadata layer compatible with the document registry.
- Use DuckDB to house tabular extracts or semi-structured CSV/Parquet conversions for rapid analytics and QA sampling.

### Template System Integration

- Introduce `VisionTemplate` definitions describing preprocessing steps, OCR engine selection, language packs, chunking strategy, and confidence thresholds.
- Extend the template registry so workflows can reference `vision` adapters by ID and version, mirroring the file template system.
- Support natural language aliases ("process this scanned invoice", "run OCR on this receipt") to ease configuration.

### Processing Flow

1. **Ingestion**: Upload image/scanned document into MinIO via the shared storage abstraction.
2. **Template Resolution**: Determine vision template using metadata, mime type, or explicit user selection.
3. **Preprocessing**: Apply deskewing, denoising, binarization, DPI normalization, and region-of-interest detection.
4. **OCR Execution**: Run the configured OCR engine; optionally split into regions for parallel processing.
5. **Layout Analysis**: Reconstruct logical order, detect tables/forms, and classify visual elements.
6. **Post-Processing**: Correct text (dictionary lookup, language-specific rules), merge columns, and filter low-confidence spans.
7. **Metadata Assembly**: Build the final document payload (text chunks, embeddings, layout metadata, QA attributes).
8. **Persistence & Indexing**: Store outputs in MinIO/DuckDB, publish to the adapter registry, enqueue for embedding/index pipelines.

## Observability & Quality

- Emit per-step metrics (preprocessing latency, OCR throughput, confidence distribution) and traces with request correlation IDs.
- Maintain sample datasets with ground truth to periodically benchmark OCR accuracy and alert on regressions.
- Provide human-review queues for low-confidence pages, capturing reviewer corrections for future model fine-tuning.

## Security & Compliance

- Enforce encryption in transit and at rest for all image artifacts.
- Integrate configurable redaction modules to mask PII before persisting or exposing OCR text.
- Log access to sensitive documents, including OCR outputs and review annotations, for auditability.

## Success Metrics

- **OCR Accuracy**: ≥ 98% character accuracy on primary document types; improve over time via feedback loops.
- **Throughput**: ≥ 150 image pages/minute per processing node for baseline OCR workflows.
- **Recovery**: < 5 minutes mean time to recover from OCR engine failures via retries or alternate models.
- **Review Efficiency**: < 10% of pages requiring manual review once tunings are in place.

## Risk Mitigation

- **Model Drift**: Schedule regular evaluation and retraining, particularly for transformer-based OCR models sensitive to domain shift.
- **Resource Constraints**: Implement GPU-aware scheduling and fallback CPU pipelines to avoid queue buildup.
- **Quality Variation**: Maintain adaptive preprocessing heuristics and user-adjustable templates for noisy scans or handwriting-heavy documents.
- **Vendor Lock-In**: Wrap third-party OCR services behind the same pipeline interface to keep swaps low-effort.

## Future Enhancements

- **Multimodal Embeddings**: Generate joint image-text embeddings (e.g., CLIP, Kosmos) for enhanced retrieval and semantic search.
- **Handwriting Recognition**: Incorporate specialized handwriting OCR models and provide per-region confidence reporting.
- **Structured Data Extraction**: Add schema-aware extractors (invoices, receipts, IDs) with validation rules and DuckDB-backed auditing views.
- **Real-Time Capture**: Support streaming ingestion from mobile capture apps or MFP devices with incremental OCR updates.

## Next Steps

1. Align on shared abstractions (storage, template registry, metadata schema).
2. Prototype the `VisionAdapter` skeleton with a single OCR engine (e.g., PaddleOCR) and simple layout parsing to validate the flow.
3. Define evaluation datasets and QA processes before scaling to advanced models or production workloads.
