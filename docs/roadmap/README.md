# ORBIT Development Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the strategic direction and planned enhancements for ORBIT (Open Retrieval-Based Inference Toolkit). Our goal is to transform ORBIT into a comprehensive enterprise-grade AI platform while maintaining its core principles of data sovereignty and open-source accessibility.

## Feature Roadmaps

### 1. [Prompt Service Enhancement](prompt-service.md)
Transforming prompt management into a comprehensive orchestration platform:
- LangChain integration
- RAG context management
- Template versioning
- Example-based management

### 2. [Workflow Adapter System](workflow-adapter-architecture.md)
Building a flexible workflow orchestration system:
- API integration
- Webhook support
- Event-driven architecture
- Workflow versioning

### 3. [Concurrency & Performance Optimization](concurrency-performance.md)
Scaling ORBIT to handle thousands of concurrent requests:
- Enhanced thread pool management
- Multi-worker uvicorn configuration
- Intelligent load balancing
- Auto-scaling and circuit breaker patterns
- Real-time performance monitoring

**Implementation Status**: The LLM Guard service has been fully integrated into Orbit. See the [LLM Guard Service Documentation](../llm-guard-service.md) for configuration and usage details.

### 5. [Asynchronous Messaging & Multi-Modal Processing](async-messaging-integration.md)
Scalable async processing with message queue protocols:
- Multi-platform message queue support (RabbitMQ, Kafka, Pub/Sub)
