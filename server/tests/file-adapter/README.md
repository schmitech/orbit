## Test Requirements

### Dependencies

All test dependencies are included in the `minimal` profile:
- `pytest>=8.3.5`
- `pytest-asyncio>=1.1.0` (for async tests)

### Additional Requirements

Some processors may require additional dependencies:
- `pypdf>=6.0.0` - PDF processing
- `python-docx>=1.2.0` - DOCX processing
- `pandas>=2.3.3` - CSV processing
- `beautifulsoup4>=4.14.1` - HTML processing
- `docling>=2.58.0` - Advanced document processing (optional)

## Test Patterns

### Async Tests

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_async_operation():
    result = await some_async_function()
    assert result is not None
```

### Fixtures

```python
@pytest_asyncio.fixture
async def service(tmp_path):
    service = FileProcessingService(config)
    yield service
    # Cleanup
    service.metadata_store.close()
```

### Temporary Files

```python
def test_with_temp_files(tmp_path):
    # tmp_path is automatically cleaned up
    test_file = tmp_path / "test.txt"
    test_file.write_text("content")
```

### Error Testing

```python
def test_error_handling():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="error message"):
        function_that_should_fail()
```

## Common Test Scenarios

### Testing File Upload

```python
result = await service.process_file(
    file_data=b"content",
    filename="test.txt",
    mime_type="text/plain",
    api_key="test_key"
)

assert result["status"] == "completed"
assert result["chunk_count"] > 0
```

### Testing Multi-tenancy

```python
# Upload with different API keys
await service.process_file(..., api_key="tenant_1")
await service.process_file(..., api_key="tenant_2")

# Verify isolation
files_1 = await service.list_files("tenant_1")
files_2 = await service.list_files("tenant_2")

assert len(files_1) == 1
assert len(files_2) == 1
```

### Testing Concurrent Operations

```python
async def upload(index):
    return await service.process_file(...)

results = await asyncio.gather(*[upload(i) for i in range(10)])
assert all(r["status"] == "completed" for r in results)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Fail with Database Locked

SQLite may have issues with concurrent access. The metadata store tests use separate database files per test via the `tmp_path` fixture.

### Tests Fail with Import Errors

Ensure you're running tests from the `server` directory:
```bash
cd server
pytest tests/file-adapter/
```

### Tests Fail with Missing Dependencies

Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e ".[minimal]"  # Core dependencies
```

### Async Test Warnings

If you see deprecation warnings about event loops, ensure you have `pytest-asyncio>=1.1.0` installed.

## Continuous Integration

These tests can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Run File Adapter Tests
  run: |
    cd server
    pytest tests/file-adapter/ \
      --cov=services/file_storage \
      --cov=services/file_processing \
      --cov=services/file_metadata \
      --cov-report=xml \
      -v
```

## Adding New Tests

When adding new tests:

1. Follow the existing naming convention: `test_<feature>_<scenario>`
2. Add docstrings explaining what the test validates
3. Use appropriate fixtures for setup/teardown
4. Group related tests in the same file
5. Add async marker for async tests: `@pytest.mark.asyncio`
6. Update this README if adding new test modules

## Performance Benchmarks

Some tests include performance checks:
- Large file processing (1MB+)
- Concurrent uploads (10-20 files)
- System under load (20+ operations)

These can be used as baseline benchmarks for performance optimization.

- Processing context file_ids storage
- Context retrieval step passing file_ids to retriever

- Chat service passing file_ids through pipeline
- Streaming chat with file_ids

**Coverage**: Chat integration with file uploads (NEW)

- Multi-tenancy file context isolation
- Complete workflow: upload → chat → delete
- Request schema validation
- Performance testing with file context

**Coverage**: HTTP chat routes with file integration (NEW)

#### `test_file_retriever_multiple_files.py`
Tests for multiple file_ids support in FileVectorRetriever:
