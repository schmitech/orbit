HTTP Datasource Implementation

Placeholder datasource for HTTP-based adapters. Unlike SQL or Elasticsearch datasources,
HTTP adapters manage their own HTTP clients per adapter (since each API has different
base URLs, authentication, etc.). This datasource exists to satisfy the datasource
registry pattern and eliminate warnings.
