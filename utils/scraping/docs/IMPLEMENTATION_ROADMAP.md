### ❌ Critical Gaps in `/src`

#### 1. **URL Extraction Pipeline**
- **Current**: Basic sitemap parsing with simple BeautifulSoup
- **Issues**: 
  - No robots.txt compliance
  - No rate limiting or politeness delays
  - Basic error handling
  - Limited URL filtering
- **Impact**: May violate website crawling etiquette and miss important content

#### 2. **Content Processing**
- **Current**: Simple HTML→Markdown with `html2text`
- **Issues**:
  - Poor document structure preservation
  - Limited content extraction quality
  - No intelligent content sectioning
- **Impact**: Lower quality input for Q&A generation

#### 3. **Question Extraction & AI Integration**
- **Current**: Basic AI prompts with minimal prompt engineering
- **Issues**:
  - No caching system (expensive API calls)
  - Limited prompt optimization
  - No concurrent processing
  - Basic question parsing
- **Impact**: Higher costs and lower quality Q&A pairs

#### 4. **Client Library & Examples**
- **Current**: Empty files (`examples/client_example.py`, `src/utils/text_processing.py`)
- **Issues**: No user-facing integration tools
- **Impact**: Poor developer experience

#### 5. **Monitoring & Operations**
- **Current**: Basic health endpoint
- **Issues**: No comprehensive monitoring, metrics, or operational dashboards
- **Impact**: Limited production readiness
