# TESTING GUIDE
# =============================================================================
#
# This file contains two types of tools:
#
# 1. BUILT-IN TOOLS (Ready to test)
#    - Calculator: percentage, add, average, divide
#    - Date/Time: current datetime, format, difference, add days
#    - JSON Transform: filter, sort, aggregate (require array of objects)
#
# 2. HTTP API TOOLS (Require configuration)
#    - Weather, Stock, Currency, etc.
#    - These have placeholder URLs (api.example.com) that must be replaced
#    - See individual tool sections for API configuration instructions
#
# =============================================================================
# TEST PROMPTS FOR BUILT-IN TOOLS
# =============================================================================
#
# Copy these prompts to test via curl or chat client:
#
# --- CALCULATOR ---
# "What percentage is 25 of 100?"
# "Add 10, 20, and 30 together"
# "What is the average of 85, 90, 78, 92?"
# "Divide 100 by 4"
#
# --- DATE/TIME ---
# "What is the current date and time?"
# "Format the date 2025-06-15 as June 15, 2025"
# "How many days between 2025-01-01 and 2025-12-31?"
# "What date is 30 days after 2025-01-18?"
#
# --- JSON TRANSFORM (must include data as JSON array of objects) ---
# 'Sort this data by price descending: [{"name": "apple", "price": 1.50}, {"name": "banana", "price": 0.75}, {"name": "orange", "price": 2.00}]'
# 'Filter where status equals active: [{"name": "Task 1", "status": "active"}, {"name": "Task 2", "status": "done"}, {"name": "Task 3", "status": "active"}]'
# 'Calculate the sum of amount: [{"item": "A", "amount": 100}, {"item": "B", "amount": 250}, {"item": "C", "amount": 150}]'
