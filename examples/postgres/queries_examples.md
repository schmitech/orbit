## Tips for Best Results

1. **Customer Names**: Always use full names when searching (e.g., "John Smith" not just "John")
2. **Dates**: Use formats like "July 20th 2025", "2025-07-20", or "07/20/2025"
3. **Amounts**: Include dollar signs and be specific (e.g., "$500", "$1000")
4. **Time Periods**: Be specific with time ranges (e.g., "last 7 days", "last month", "past 30 days")
5. **Status Values**: Use exact status terms: pending, processing, shipped, delivered, cancelled
6. **Cities**: Use proper city names with correct spelling
7. **Email Addresses**: Include the full email address with @ symbol

## Common Parameter Patterns

- **days_back**: "last 7 days", "past 30 days", "last month", "this week"
- **min_amount/max_amount**: "$100", "$500", "$1000"
- **customer_name**: Full names like "John Smith", "Jane Doe"
- **customer_id**: Numeric IDs like "123", "456", "#789"
- **status**: "pending", "processing", "shipped", "delivered", "cancelled"
- **city**: "New York", "Los Angeles", "Chicago", "San Francisco"
- **limit**: "top 5", "top 10", "show me 20"

## Troubleshooting

If a query doesn't work:
1. Check if you're using the exact parameter format expected
2. Ensure customer names are complete and properly spelled
3. Use the date format YYYY-MM-DD for exact dates
4. Include currency symbols for amounts
5. Be specific about time periods using "days" terminology
