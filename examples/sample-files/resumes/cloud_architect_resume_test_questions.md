## 🔍 **General Comparison Questions**
1. Compare all four candidates and identify which one is the strongest overall fit for a Cloud Architect role.
2. Summarize each candidate’s strengths and weaknesses in one paragraph each.
3. Rank the candidates from most to least qualified, and justify the ranking using evidence found in each resume.
4. Identify which candidate has the broadest cloud ecosystem experience (AWS, Azure, GCP).
5. Who demonstrates the strongest architectural leadership capability? Provide reasoning.

## 🛠️ **Skills & Technical Depth**
6. Which candidate has the most advanced Terraform or IaC experience?
7. Identify which candidates show hands-on Kubernetes experience, and compare depth level.
8. Which resume demonstrates the deepest understanding of enterprise or multi-account cloud design?
9. Which candidate’s skills best align with a Zero Trust or regulated‑industry cloud environment?
10. Detect any skill gaps that might hinder success in a senior Cloud Architect role.

11. Which candidate has the strongest background in cloud cost optimization (FinOps)?
12. Compare the experience of candidates who have built microservices or event‑driven architectures.
13. Which candidate shows the clearest migration/modernization background (e.g., monolith to microservices)?
14. Who has the most relevant experience for a hybrid-cloud or multi-cloud position?
15. Determine which candidate has the most direct experience with cloud governance and guardrails.

## 🧠 **Advanced Analytical Reasoning**
26. Identify which resume most closely aligns with modern cloud architecture trends (2023+).
27. Predict which candidate might struggle in a highly autonomous environment and explain why.
28. Assess which candidate is the most “future‑proof” based on technologies and patterns mentioned.
29. Determine which candidate has the most balanced mix of technical depth and architectural strategy.
30. Infer which candidate has the highest business-level influence based on resume language.

## 🔎 **Cross‑Resume Attribute Matching**
31. Detect skills that appear in all resumes (shared baseline knowledge).
32. Identify which skills appear **only** in one resume (unique differentiators).
33. Compare Kubernetes depth across all candidates and map gaps.
34. Find keywords indicating leadership vs. hands-on engineering focus.
